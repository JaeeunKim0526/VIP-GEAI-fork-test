### [`01-intro-to-robotics`](https://github.com/raghavauppuluri13/VIP-GEAI/blob/master/01-intro_to_robotics.ipynb)

This initial project aims to provide a "Hello World" into robot manipulation. 

You will implement basic versions of standard robot kinematics algorithms and control for a 2D robot arm:
- Computing forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, jacobian
- PD control

Also, you will get exposure to using APIs for [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) a standard framework used for representing reinforcement learning environments 
(specifically the MuJoCo [`reacher`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/reacher/) environment).
